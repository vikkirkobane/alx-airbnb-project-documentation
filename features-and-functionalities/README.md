# Task 0: Documenting Project Features and Functionalities

## Objective
The objective of this task is to identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project by creating a detailed visual representation using Draw.io.

## Instructions

1. **Review Project Requirements**:
      - Familiarize yourself with the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend, which include:
        - User Authentication
        - Property Management
        - Booking System
        - Payment Processing
        - Reviews and Ratings
        - Notifications System
        - Admin Dashboard

2. **Create Diagram Using Draw.io**:
      - Open Draw.io (also known as Diagrams.net).
      - Create a new diagram that captures the following features and functionalities:
        - **User Authentication**: User registration, login, profile management.
        - **Property Management**: Adding, editing, and deleting property listings.
        - **Booking System**: Creating, canceling, and tracking bookings.
        - **Payment Processing**: Handling payments and payouts to hosts.
        - **Reviews and Ratings**: Allowing guests to leave feedback and hosts to respond.
        - **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications for important events.
        - **Admin Dashboard**: Monitoring users, properties, bookings, and payments.

3. **Export Your Design**:
      - Once the diagram is complete, export it as a PNG file.
      - Name the file something descriptive, such as `airbnb_clone_features.png`.

4. **Store the PNG File**:
      - Create a directory called `features-and-functionalities/` within your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
      - Upload the PNG file into this directory.

5. **Commit and Push Changes**:
      - Commit your changes with a relevant message, such as "Added features and functionalities diagram".
      - Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

## Example Git Commands
bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/alx-airbnb-project-documentation

# Create the new directory
mkdir features-and-functionalities

# Move the PNG file into the new directory
mv path/to/airbnb_clone_features.png features-and-functionalities/

# Stage the changes
git add features-and-functionalities/airbnb_clone_features.png

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Added features and functionalities diagram"

# Push the changes to the repository
